# NTC Thermostat Exercise

## Functionality

> With a grid containing value for each 10 Celsius degrees between 0 and 100 and a Binary Search Algorithm.
> We try to find the temperature given by the NTC Thermostat sensor

## Algorithm

> Binary Search Algorithm
> Interpolation from ADC to Temperature
